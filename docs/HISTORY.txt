Changelog
=========

------------------

* Moved to Python3.6+. Python2 support dropped.


1.3.6 (2018/01/15)
------------------

1.3.4 (2014/04/15)

  DefaultProperty.


1.3.3 (2013/12/20)

* Update collection javascript not to bind events on the document
  anymore, but on the field. This prevent breakage if the events get
  intercepted. The reordering buttons no longer submit the form, even
  if the javascript isn't included.

* Allow people to customize the ``disabled`` attributes on fields.

  requires at least jQuery 1.7.

------------------

* Update fields to properly pass along ``zope.schema`` the
  ``contrainValue`` validator.

* Fix all fields to properly handle required (it got broken in the
  previous release for some fields).


1.3 (2012/10/12)
----------------

* Update fields and widgets to no longer proxy
  ``zope.schema``. Instead they do their own validation and are
  standalone (they can be created and used without ``zope.schema``).

* Support more HTML 5 features, like for number fields, and extra
  attributes that can be inserted with the help of ``htmlAttributes``,
  like ``placeholder``...

* Add a ``CurrencyField``, that can be used to display nicely
  currencies.

  ``False``.


1.2.1 (2012/04/27)
------------------

* Improve choice widgets, to make possible to customize the source of
  it. Add support for a ``IFormSourceBinder``, that works like a
  ``IContextSourceBinder`` except it takes the form as parameter
  instead of the context (thus giving access to request as well for
  instance).

* Add a method ``delete`` to the data manager.

* Now use ``grokcore.chameleon`` instead of ``megrok.chameleon``.


1.2 (2011/11/08)
----------------

* Improve error reporting in collection widgets. Thanks to Novareto
  for the sponsorship.

* Add an validation option in collection widgets while adding and
  removing values from it. Thanks to Novareto for the sponsorship.

* Improve Javascript for collection widgets. Add an extra with
  fanstatic to automatically require required files.

* If a collection widget is required, it will by default display one
  empty item in the collection when it is empty. That prevent an extra
  click to add it.

* Various fixes in ``InvariantsValidator``.

* ``SchemaWidgetExtractor`` and ``SchemaField`` now catch Invalid
  exceptions.

* Add support for the HTML 5 attribute required in every template. Use
  the attribute novalidate on the form tag to disable it.

* Add a display widget for object and uri fields.

  validator.
